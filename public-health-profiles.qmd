# Profiles for England and Wales

Commonly referred to as Fingertips Public Health data can be found through the [dashboard](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/).

This is also available through APIs in R (not through CRAN):

[{fingertipsR}](https://github.com/ropensci/fingertipsR)

### R code to install

{remotes} is a package that is needed to install from GitHub so is commented out as it's installed once:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("rOpenSci/fingertipsR",
                        build_vignettes = TRUE,
                        dependencies = "suggests")
```

Note that the example code in the README for this package is base R so may not looks and works different to {tidyverse} coding. 
Base R and {tidyverse} do work together though and some code may mix the two approaches to coding.

and Python:

[fingertips_py](https://fingertips-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Charts

### R packages

- [{fingertipscharts}](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/fingertipscharts) helps users to easily reproduce charts from Fingertips data.
- [{PHEindicatormethods}](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/PHEindicatormethods) supports execution of statistical methods approved for use in the production of PHE indicators such as those presented via Fingertips.
- [{FunnelPlotR}](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/FunnelPlotR) - produces funnel plots with adjustments for over dispersion methods.

### Examples of visualisations

Examples of visualisations that use Public Health data can be found at [Trafford Data Lab](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/) with code open on [GitHub](https://github.com/traffordDataLab).
