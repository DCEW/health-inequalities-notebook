## Postcodes 

### England

Homelessness and no fixed abode have implications for commissioning under usual place of residence but also for health inequality analysis.
The guidance for [commissioner assignment](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/commissioner-assignment-method-flow-chart-2024-25-accompanying-guidance-and-reference-tables/) can help understand how data has been entered and what that intention was, for example, postcodes may be from the main site of the provider delivering care.
Although the guidance says to use `ZZ99 3VZ` for `No Fixed Abode` but it may be that the data was added without this knowledge or from before the guidance and is still applicable.

`Address not known` should be `ZZ99 3WZ`.

Note that some `ZZ` postcodes will related to unspecified UK country codes:

- `England UK â€“ not specified` - `Z99 3CZ`  
- `Wales` - `ZZ99 3GZ`  
- `Scotland` - `ZZ99 1WZ`  
- `Northern Ireland` - `ZZ99 2WZ`
